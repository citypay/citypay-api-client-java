  description: "\nWelcome to the CityPay API, a robust HTTP API payment solution designed\
    \ for seamless server-to-server \ntransactional processing. Our API facilitates\
    \ a wide array of payment operations, catering to diverse business needs. \nWhether\
    \ you're integrating Internet payments, handling Mail Order/Telephone Order (MOTO)\
    \ transactions, managing \nSubscriptions with Recurring and Continuous Authority\
    \ payments, or navigating the complexities of 3-D Secure \nauthentication, our\
    \ API is equipped to support your requirements. Additionally, we offer functionalities\
    \ for \nAuthorisation, Refunding, Pre-Authorisation, Cancellation/Voids, and Completion\
    \ processing, alongside the capability \nfor tokenised payments.\n\n## Compliance\
    \ and Security Overview\n<aside class=\"notice\">\n  Ensuring the security of\
    \ payment transactions and compliance with industry standards is paramount. Our\
    \ API is \n  designed with stringent security measures and compliance protocols\
    \ to safeguard sensitive information and meet \n  the rigorous requirements of\
    \ Visa, MasterCard, and the PCI Security Standards Council.\n</aside>\n\n### Key\
    \ Compliance and Security Measures\n\n* **TLS Encryption**: All data transmissions\
    \ must utilise TLS version 1.2 or higher, employing [strong cryptography](#enabled-tls-ciphers).\
    \ Our infrastructure strictly enforces this requirement to maintain the integrity\
    \ and confidentiality of data in transit. We conduct regular scans and assessments\
    \ of our TLS endpoints to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.\n* **Data Storage\
    \ Prohibitions**: Storing sensitive cardholder data (CHD), such as the card security\
    \ code (CSC) or primary account number (PAN), is strictly prohibited. Our API\
    \ is designed to minimize your exposure to sensitive data, thereby reducing your\
    \ compliance burden.\n* **Data Masking**: For consumer protection and compliance,\
    \ full card numbers must not be displayed on receipts or any customer-facing materials.\
    \ Our API automatically masks PANs, displaying only the last four digits to facilitate\
    \ safe receipt generation.\n* **Network Scans**: If your application is web-based,\
    \ regular scans of your hosting environment are mandatory to identify and rectify\
    \ potential vulnerabilities. This proactive measure is crucial for maintaining\
    \ a secure and compliant online presence.\n* **PCI Compliance**: Adherence to\
    \ PCI DSS standards is not optional; it's a requirement for operating securely\
    \ and legally in the payments ecosystem. For detailed information on compliance\
    \ requirements and resources, please visit the PCI Security Standards Council\
    \ website [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).\n\
    * **Request Validation**: Our API includes mechanisms to verify the legitimacy\
    \ of each request, ensuring it pertains to a valid account and originates from\
    \ a trusted source. We leverage remote IP address verification alongside sophisticated\
    \ application firewall technologies to thwart a wide array of common security\
    \ threats.\n\n## Getting Started\nBefore integrating with the CityPay API, ensure\
    \ your application and development practices align with the outlined compliance\
    \ and security measures. This preparatory step is crucial for a smooth integration\
    \ process and the long-term success of your payment processing operations.\n\n\
    For further details on API endpoints, request/response formats, and code examples,\
    \ proceed to the subsequent sections of our documentation. Our aim is to provide\
    \ you with all the necessary tools and information to integrate our payment processing\
    \ capabilities seamlessly into your application.\n\nThank you for choosing CityPay\
    \ API. We look forward to supporting your payment processing needs with our secure,\
    \ compliant, and versatile API solution.\n"

- description: "The Payment Processing API is designed for MOTO (Mail Order/Telephone\
    \ Order), e-commerce, and continuous authority \ntransactions. It incorporates\
    \ advanced fraud and risk assessments, 3D Secure authentication flows, and transaction\
    \ \nquerying capabilities to streamline your payment operations securely.\n\n\n\
    ### Understanding the Authorisation Process\n\nThe authorisation process is a\
    \ critical component in payment processing, enabling standard transaction authorisation\n\
    based on the parameters provided in its request. The CityPay gateway facilitates\
    \ this by routing your transaction\nthrough to an Acquiring bank and to the appropriate\
    \ card scheme, such as Visa, MasterCard or American Express.\n\nOur API is optimized\
    \ for server environments that process transactions in real-time. It supports\
    \ various transaction types, including:\n\n- E-commerce\n- Mail order and telephone\
    \ order\n- Customer present transactions (keyed entry)\n- Continuous authority\
    \ and pre-authorisation\n\nWe tailor your account with specific acquirer configurations\
    \ to ensure smooth transactions through our gateway.\n\nDifferent transaction\
    \ environments may require specific data elements. Our API is designed to be flexible,\
    \ accommodating these various requirements with the support of our dedicated integration\
    \ team.\n\n### E-commerce workflows\n\nOur API simplifies 3D Secure integrations\
    \ for e-commerce transactions, reducing the need for direct accreditation with\
    \ Visa and MasterCard. This built-in mechanism manages authentication processes\
    \ and enhances security by shifting potential liability from the merchant to the\
    \ cardholder. The authentication produces a Cardholder Authentication Verification\
    \ Value (CAVV) and an E-commerce Indicator (ECI) that are crucial for the transaction\
    \ validation.\n\nCityPay supports 3DS version 2.2, aligned with EU regulations\
    \ for Secure Customer Authentication (SCA), and is compatible with Verified by\
    \ Visa, MasterCard Identity Check, and American Express SafeKey 2.2.\n\n#### Non-3D\
    \ Secure Transactions\n\n![3DSv2 Frctionless Flow](images/3dsv2-no3d.png)\n\n\
    Some transactions may bypass 3D Secure processing due to authentication issues\
    \ or deliberate \"attempted\" checks. These transactions will not qualify for\
    \ a liability shift and could be declined.\n\n#### Frictionless 3D Secure\n\n\
    ![3DSv2 Frctionless Flow](images/3dsv2-frictionless.png)\n\nFor low-risk transactions,\
    \ our API supports a frictionless 3D Secure process. It allows for authentication\
    \ without disrupting the user experience, requiring no redirection or additional\
    \ interaction from the cardholder.\n\n#### Challenged 3D Secure\n\n![3DSv2 Frctionless\
    \ Flow](images/3dsv2-challenge.png)\n\nHigher-risk transactions may be \"challenged,\"\
    \ requiring the cardholder to authenticate the transaction. In such cases,  \n\
    the API will return a [request challenge](#requestchallenged) which will require\
    \ your integration to forward the\ncardholder's browser to the given [ACS url](#acsurl).\
    \ This should be performed by posting the [creq](#creq) value\n(the challenge\
    \ request value).\n\n\nOnce complete, the ACS will have already been in touch\
    \ with our servers by sending us a result of the authentication\nknown as `RReq`.\n\
    \n\nTo maintain session state, a parameter `threeDSSessionData` can be posted\
    \ to the ACS url and will be returned alongside\nthe `CRes` value. This will ensure\
    \ that any controller code will be able to isolate state between calls. This field\n\
    is to be used by your own systems rather than ours and may be any value which\
    \ can uniquely identify your cardholder's\nsession. As an option, we do provide\
    \ a `threedserver_trans_id` value in the `RequestChallenged` packet which can\
    \ be used\nfor the `threeDSSessionData` value as it is used to uniquely identify\
    \ the 3D-Secure session.\n\nA common method of maintaining state is to provide\
    \ a session related query string value in the `merchant_termurl` value\n(also\
    \ known as the `notificationUrl`). For example providing a url of `https://mystore.com/checkout?token=asny2348w4561..`\n\
    could return the user directly back to their session with your environment.\n\n\
    Once you have received a `cres` post from the ACS authentication service, this\
    \ should be POSTed to the [cres](#cres)\nendpoint to perform full authorisation\
    \ processing.\n\nPlease note that the CRes returned to us is purely a mechanism\
    \ of acknowledging that transactions should be committed for\nauthorisation. The\
    \ ACS by this point will have sent us the verification value (CAVV) to perform\
    \ a liability shift. The CRes\nvalue will be validated for receipt of the CAVV\
    \ and subsequently may return response codes illustrating this.\n\nTo forward\
    \ the user to the ACS, we recommend a simple auto submit HTML form.\n\n> Simple\
    \ auto submit HTML form\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n        <title>Forward\
    \ to ACS</title>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        function onLoadEvent()\
    \ { \n            document.acs.submit(); \n        }\n        </script>\n    \
    \    <noscript>You will require JavaScript to be enabled to complete this transaction</noscript>\n\
    \    </head>\n    <body onload=\"onLoadEvent();\">\n        <form name=\"acs\"\
    \ action=\"{{ACSURL from Response}}\" method=\"POST\">\n            <input type=\"\
    hidden\" name=\"creq\" value=\"{{CReq Packet from Response}}\" />\n          \
    \  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"threeDSSessionData\" value=\"{{session-identifier}}\"\
    \ />\n        </form>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nA full ACS test suite is available\
    \ for 3DSv2 testing.\n\n### Testing 3DSv2 Integrations\n\nThe API includes a simulated\
    \ 3DSv2 handler that executes various scenarios determined by the Card Security\
    \ Code (CSC) value provided in the transaction request. This feature allows developers\
    \ to test different outcomes and behaviors in a controlled environment.\n\n| CSC\
    \ Value | Behaviour                                                          \

    The Direct Post Method for e-commerce payment is generally used by merchants that require more control over their
    payment form “look and feel” and can understand and implement the extra PCI DSS security controls that are required to
    protect their systems.

    The Direct Post Method uses the merchant’s website to generate the shopping cart and payment web pages. The merchant’s
    payment form, loaded in the customer’s browser, sends the cardholder data directly to CityPay’s API, ensuring cardholder
    data is not stored, processed, or transmitted via the merchant systems. The payment form, however, is provided by the
    merchant. The merchant’s systems are therefore in scope for additional PCI DSS controls, which are necessary to protect
    the merchant website against malicious individuals changing the form and capturing cardholder data.

    ### Direct Post Flow

    #### Simple Authorisation Flow

    The merchant’s website creates the payment page.

    1. The customer’s browser displays the payment page and posts the cardholder data directly to CityPay as a url-encoded
       payment form.
    2. CityPay receives the cardholder data and sends it for online authorisation, handling any ThreeDSecure authorisation
       challenges
    3. The merchant receives a HTTP 303 redirect, containing the result of the transaction as query parameters

    <img src="images/direct-post-flow.png" width="600" />

    #### Tokenisation Authorisation Flow

    The merchant’s website creates the payment page.

    1. The customer’s browser displays the payment page and posts the cardholder data directly to CityPay as a url-encoded
       payment form.
    2. CityPay receives the cardholder data and processes any ThreeDSecure authorisation and challenges.
    3. The merchant receives a HTTP `303` redirect containing the card details tokenised for consequential processing
    4. Once final confirmation is agreed at checkout, the generated token is forward to CityPay for realtime authorisation.
       This may by using HTTP redirects in a direct manner, or via an api level call

    #### Handling Redirects

    The direct post method uses HTTP `303` redirects to return data to your system. A `303` redirect differs to conventional 301
    or `302` redirects by telling the browser to not resend data if refresh is pressed.

    Payments should be developed to cater for failure. Transactions may not complete authorisation at the challenge stage or
    decline either due to insufficient funds or transient network conditions. To ensure correct payment flow, the direct
    post API requires

    1. a `redirectSuccess` url. This is used to forward the result of authorisation.
    2. a `redirectFailure` url. This is used to forward any errors that are due to invalid requests or payment failures.

    #### Domain Keys

    To allow for processing of transactions in a direct manner, CityPay provide domain keys. This value is provided on the
    initial direct post call and must be run on a pre-registered host. Our validation processes will check the `Origin` or
    `Referer`   HTTP headers to ensure that the domain keys are valid. A domain key can be registered for 1 or more domains.

    post:
      description: "CityPay Paylink supports invoice and bill payment services by\
        \ allowing merchants to raise an invoice in their systems and\nassociate the\
        \ invoice with a Paylink checkout token. CityPay will co-ordinate the checkout\
        \ flow in relationship with\nyour customer. Our bill payment solution may\
        \ be used to streamline the payment flow with cardholders to allow your\n\
        invoice to be paid promptly and via multiple payment channels such as Card\
        \ Payment, Apple Pay or Google Pay.\n\nThe bill payment service allows\n\n\
        1. setting up notification paths to an end customer, such as SMS or Email\n\
        2. enabling attachments to be included with Paylink tokens\n3. produce chaser\
        \ notifications for unpaid invoices\n4. provide callbacks for notification\
        \ of the payment of an invoice\n5. support part payments against an invoice\n\
        6. support of field guards to protect the payment screen\n7. support of status\
        \ reporting on tokens\n8. URL short codes for SMS notifications\n\n<img src=\"\
        images/merchant-BPS-workflow.png\" alt=\"Paylink BPSv2 Overview\" width=\"\
        50%\"/> \n\n\n### Notification Paths\n\nNotification paths can be provided\
        \ which identify the channels for communication of the invoice availability.\n\
        Up to 3 notification paths may be provided per request.\n\nEach notification\
        \ uses a template to generate the body of the message. This allows for variable\
        \ text to be sent out and\ncustomised for each call.\n\nSMS messages use URL\
        \ Short Codes (USC) as a payment link to the invoice payment page. This allows\
        \ for a standard payment\nURL to be shortened for optimised usage in SMS.\
        \ For instance a URL of `https://checkout.citypay.com/PL1234/s348yb8yna4a48n2f8nq2f3msgyng-psn348ynaw8ynaw/en`\n\
        becomes `citypay.com/Za48na3x`. Each USC is unique however it is a requirement\
        \ that each USC generated is protected\nwith Field Guards to ensure that sensitive\
        \ data (such as customer contact details and GDPR) is protected.\n\nTo send\
        \ a notification path, append a `notification-path` property to the request.\n\
        \n```json\n {\n  \"sms_notification_path\": {\n      \"to\": \"+441534884000\"\
        \n  },\n  \"email_notification_path\": {\n      \"to\": [\"help-desk@citypay.com\"\
        ],\n      \"cc\": [\"third-party@citypay.com\"],\n      \"reply\": [\"help@my-company.com\"\
        ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNotification paths trigger a number of events which are\
        \ stored as part of the timeline of events of a Paylink token\n\n- `BillPaymentSmsNotificationQueued`\
        \ - identifies when an SMS notification has been queued for delivery\n- `BillPaymentSmsNotificationSent`\
        \ - identifies when an SMS notification has been sent to the upstream network\n\
        - `BillPaymentSmsNotificationDelivered` - identifies when an SMS notification\
        \ has been delivered as notified by the upstream network\n- `BillPaymentSmsNotificationUndelivered`\
        \ - identifies when an SMS notification has undelivered notification is provided\
        \ by the upstream network\n- `BillPaymentSmsNotificationFailure` - identifies\
        \ when an SMS notification has failed\n- `BillPaymentEmailNotificationQueued`\
        \ -  identifies when an email notification has been queued for delivery\n\
        - `BillPaymentEmailNotificationSent` -  identifies when an email notification\
        \ has been accepted by our SMS forwarder\n- `BillPaymentEmailNotificationFailure`\
        \ - identifies when an email notification has failed delivery\n\n\n#### SMS\
        \ Notification Path\n\nSMS originated from a CityPay pool of numbers and by\
        \ default only sends to country codes where the service is registered.\nSMSs\
        \ may contain a From field which is configured as part of you onboarding and\
        \ have a name associated to identify the service\norigin. For example if your\
        \ business is titled `Health Surgery Ltd` the SMS may be sent to originate\
        \ from `Health Surgery`. \n\nSMS is also configured for a \"polite mode\"\
        . This mode ensures that SMSs aren't sent in the middle of the night when\
        \ backend\nservices ordinarily run. SMSs will be queued until the time range\
        \ is deemed as polite. Normally this is between 8am and 9pm.\n\n| Field  \

        \ that invoices are paid by the intended recipient, Paylink supports the addition\
        \ of Field Guards.\n\nA Field Guard is an intended field which is to be used\
        \ as a form of guarded authentication. More than 1 field can be\nrequested.\n\
        \n<img src=\"images/paylink-field-guards.png\" alt=\"Paylink Field Guards\"\
        \ width=\"50%\"/>\n\nTo determine the source value of the field, each field\
        \ name is searched in the order of\n\n- identifier\n- cardholder data such\
        \ as name\n- custom parameters\n- pass through data\n\nIf no field values\
        \ are found, the token request returns a D041 validation error.\n\n#### Authentication\
        \ and Validation\n\nWhen values are entered by the user, resultant comparisons\
        \ are performed by\n\n1. Transliteration of both the source value and entered\
        \ value. For example, names with accents (e.g. é will become e)\n2. Only Alphanumeric\
        \ values are retained any whitespace or special characters are ignored\n3.\
        \ Case is ignored\n\nShould all values match, the user is authenticated and\
        \ can continue to the payment form rendered by the Paylink server.\n\nOn successful\
        \ login, an event will be added to include that the access guard validated\
        \ access.\n\n#### Access-Key\n\nTo ensure that a user does not need to re-enter\
        \ these values multiple times, a cookie is pushed to the user’s\nbrowser with\
        \ an access-key digest value. This value will be presented to the server on\
        \ each refresh therefore\nallowing the guard to accept the call. Each value\
        \ is uniquely stored per merchant account and cannot be shared cross\nmerchant.\
        \ The lifetime of the cookie is set to 24 hours.\n\n#### Brute Force Prevention\n\
        \nTo prevent multiple calls hitting the server, attempting a brute force attack,\
        \ the login process\n\n1. is fronted by a contemporary web application firewall\n\
        2. creates an event for each token when access was denied\n3. should the number\
        \ of failed events breach more than 5 in 30 minutes, the token is locked for\
        \ an hour\n4. should the number of events breach more than 20 the token is\
        \ fully locked\n\n### Attachments\n\nAttachments can be included in the request\
        \ in 2 ways\n\n1. Via a data element direct in the request\n2. Via a URL upload\
        \ to a provided pre-signed URL\n\nThe decision of which option is dependent\
        \ on the size of the attachments. Should the attachment size be greater than\n\
        32kb a URL upload is required. Small attachments can be included in the JSON\
        \ request. This is to prevent our web\nfirewall from blocking your request\
        \ and to also ensure efficiency of larger file uploads.\n\nThere is a maximum\
        \ of 3 attachments that can be added to a request.\n\n```json\n    [{\n  \

            The card number must be treated as sensitive data. We only provide an obfuscated value in logging and reporting.
             The plaintext value is encrypted in our database using AES 256 GMC bit encryption for settlement or refund purposes.

            When providing the card number to our gateway through the authorisation API you will be handling the card data on
            your application. This will require further PCI controls to be in place and this value must never be stored.

            (American Express has it on the front). The value helps to identify possession of the card as it is not
            available within the chip or magnetic swipe.

            When forwarding the CSC, please ensure the value is a string as some values start with 0 and this will be stripped
            out by any integer parsing.

            The CSC number aids fraud prevention in Mail Order and Internet payments.

            Business rules are available on your account to identify whether to accept
            or decline transactions based on mismatched results of the CSC.

            The Payment Card Industry (PCI) requires that at no stage of a transaction should the CSC be stored.

            This applies to all entities handling card data.

            It should also not be used in any hashing process.

            CityPay do not store the value and have no method of retrieving the value once the transaction has been processed.
            For this reason, duplicate checking is unable to determine the CSC in its duplication check algorithm.

             `1` for an enforced policy. Transactions that are enforced will be rejected if the CSC value does not match.

             `2` to bypass. Transactions that are bypassed will be allowed through even if the CSC did not match.

            the window, any subsequent transaction will result in a T001 result.

            Values are

             `0` for the default policy (default value if not supplied). Your default values are determined by your account manager on setup of the account.

             `1` for an enforced policy. Transactions that are enforced will be checked for duplication within the duplication window.

             `2` to bypass. Transactions that are bypassed will not be checked for duplication within the duplication window.

             `3` to ignore. Transactions that are ignored will have the same affect as bypass.

            The value should be a valid printable string with ASCII character ranges from 0x32 to 0x127.

            The identifier is recommended to be distinct for each transaction such as a [random unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
            this will aid in ensuring each transaction is identifiable.

            When transactions are processed they are also checked for duplicate requests. Changing the identifier on a subsequent
            request will ensure that a transaction is considered as different.

            description: |
              A tag is a label that you can attach to a payment authorisation.
              Tags can help you group transactions together based on certain criteria, like a work job or a ticket number.
              They can also assist in filtering transactions when you're generating reports.

              Limitations:
              There is a maximum limit of 3 tags that can be added to a single transaction. Each tag can be no longer than 20
              characters and alphanumeric with no spaces.

              Example:
              Let's say you're a software company and you have different teams working on various projects. When a team makes
              a purchase or incurs an expense, they can tag the transaction with the project name, the team name, and the
              type of expense.

              - Project Name: Project_X
              - Team Name: Team_A
              - Type of Expense: Hardware

              This way, when you're looking at your financial reports, you can easily filter transactions based on these
              tags to see how much each project or team is spending on different types of expenses.

        cardholder_agreement:
          description: |
            Merchant-initiated transactions (MITs) are payments you trigger, where the cardholder has previously consented
            to you carrying out such payments. These may be scheduled (such as recurring payments and installments) or
            unscheduled (like account top-ups triggered by balance thresholds and no-show charges).

            Scheduled
            ---
            These are regular payments using stored card details, like installments or a monthly subscription fee.

            - `I` Instalment - A single purchase of goods or services billed to a cardholder in multiple transactions, over a period of time agreed by the cardholder and you.

            - `R` Recurring - Transactions processed at fixed, regular intervals not to exceed one year between transactions, representing an agreement between a cardholder and you to purchase goods or services provided over a period of time.

            Unscheduled
            ---
            These are payments using stored card details that do not occur on a regular schedule, like top-ups for a
            digital wallet triggered by the balance falling below a certain threshold.

            - `A` Reauthorisation - a purchase made after the original purchase. A common scenario is delayed/split shipments.

            - `C` Unscheduled Payment - A transaction using a stored credential for a fixed or variable amount that does not occur on a scheduled or regularly occurring transaction date. This includes account top-ups triggered by balance thresholds.

            - `D` Delayed Charge - A delayed charge is typically used in hotel, cruise lines and vehicle rental environments to perform a supplemental account charge after original services are rendered.

            - `L` Incremental - An incremental authorisation is typically found in hotel and car rental environments, where the cardholder has agreed to pay for any service incurred during the duration of the contract. An incremental authorisation is where you need to seek authorisation of further funds in addition to what you have originally requested. A common scenario is additional services charged to the contract, such as extending a stay in a hotel.

            - `S` Resubmission - When the original purchase occurred, but you were not able to get authorisation at the time the goods or services were provided. It should be only used where the goods or services have already been provided, but the authorisation request is declined for insufficient funds.

            - `X` No-show - A no-show is a transaction where you are enabled to charge for services which the cardholder entered into an agreement to purchase, but the cardholder did not meet the terms of the agreement.

            The Card Security Code (CSC) (also known as CV2/CVV2) is normally found on the back of the card
            (American Express has it on the front). The value helps to identify possession of the card as it is not
            available within the chip or magnetic swipe.

            When forwarding the CSC, please ensure the value is a string as some values start with 0 and this will be stripped
            out by any integer parsing.

            The CSC number aids fraud prevention in Mail Order and Internet payments.

            Business rules are available on your account to identify whether to accept
            or decline transactions based on mismatched results of the CSC.

            The Payment Card Industry (PCI) requires that at no stage of a transaction should the CSC be stored.

            This applies to all entities handling card data.

            It should also not be used in any hashing process.

            CityPay do not store the value and have no method of retrieving the value once the transaction has been processed.
            For this reason, duplicate checking is unable to determine the CSC in its duplication check algorithm.

            A policy value which determines whether a duplication policy is enforced or bypassed. A duplication check has a window

            the window, any subsequent transaction will result in a T001 result.

            Values are

             `0` for the default policy (default value if not supplied). Your default values are determined by your account manager on setup of the account.

             `1` for an enforced policy. Transactions that are enforced will be checked for duplication within the duplication window.

             `2` to bypass. Transactions that are bypassed will not be checked for duplication within the duplication window.

            The value should be a valid printable string with ASCII character ranges from 0x32 to 0x127.

            The identifier is recommended to be distinct for each transaction such as a [random unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
            this will aid in ensuring each transaction is identifiable.

            When transactions are processed they are also checked for duplicate requests. Changing the identifier on a subsequent
            request will ensure that a transaction is considered as different.

            Transactions charged using the API are defined as:

            **Cardholder Initiated**: A _cardholder initiated transaction_ (CIT) is where the cardholder selects the
            card for use for a purchase using previously stored details. An example would be a customer buying an item from
            your website after being present with their saved card details at checkout.

            **Merchant Intiated**: A _merchant initiated transaction_ (MIT) is an authorisation initiated where you as the
             merchant submit a cardholders previously stored details without the cardholder's participation. An example would
             be a subscription to a membership scheme to debit their card monthly.

            MITs have different reasons such as reauthorisation, delayed, unscheduled, incremental, recurring, instalment, no-show or resubmission.

            The following values apply

             - `M` - specifies that the transaction is initiated by the merchant

             - `C` - specifies that the transaction is initiated by the cardholder

            Where transactions are merchant initiated, a valid cardholder agreement must be defined.

            description: |
              A tag is a label that you can attach to a payment authorisation.
              Tags can help you group transactions together based on certain criteria, like a work job or a ticket number.
              They can also assist in filtering transactions when you're generating reports.

              Limitations:
              There is a maximum limit of 3 tags that can be added to a single transaction. Each tag can be no longer than 20
              characters and alphanumeric with no spaces.

              Example:
              Let's say you're a software company and you have different teams working on various projects. When a team makes
              a purchase or incurs an expense, they can tag the transaction with the project name, the team name, and the
              type of expense.

              - Project Name: Project_X
              - Team Name: Team_A
              - Type of Expense: Hardware

              This way, when you're looking at your financial reports, you can easily filter transactions based on these
              tags to see how much each project or team is spending on different types of expenses.

            provided value.

            The card number must be treated as sensitive data. We only provide an obfuscated value in logging and reporting.
             The plaintext value is encrypted in our database using AES 256 GMC bit encryption for settlement or refund purposes.

            When providing the card number to our gateway through the authorisation API you will be handling the card data on
            your application. This will require further PCI controls to be in place and this value must never be stored.

          description: |
            The Card Security Code (CSC) (also known as CV2/CVV2) is normally found on the back of the card
            (American Express has it on the front). The value helps to identify possession of the card as it is not
            available within the chip or magnetic swipe.

            When forwarding the CSC, please ensure the value is a string as some values start with 0 and this will be stripped
            out by any integer parsing.

            The CSC number aids fraud prevention in Mail Order and Internet payments.

            Business rules are available on your account to identify whether to accept
            or decline transactions based on mismatched results of the CSC.

            The Payment Card Industry (PCI) requires that at no stage of a transaction should the CSC be stored.

            This applies to all entities handling card data.

            It should also not be used in any hashing process.

            CityPay do not store the value and have no method of retrieving the value once the transaction has been processed.
            For this reason, duplicate checking is unable to determine the CSC in its duplication check algorithm.

             `2` to bypass. Transactions that are bypassed will be allowed through even if the CSC did not match.

            A policy value which determines whether a duplication policy is enforced or bypassed. A duplication check has a window

            the window, any subsequent transaction will result in a T001 result.

            Values are

             `0` for the default policy (default value if not supplied). Your default values are determined by your account manager on setup of the account.

             `1` for an enforced policy. Transactions that are enforced will be checked for duplication within the duplication window.

             `2` to bypass. Transactions that are bypassed will not be checked for duplication within the duplication window.

             post processing actions and to aid in reconciliation of transactions.

            The value should be a valid printable string with ASCII character ranges from 0x32 to 0x127.

            The identifier is recommended to be distinct for each transaction such as a [random unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
            this will aid in ensuring each transaction is identifiable.

            When transactions are processed they are also checked for duplicate requests. Changing the identifier on a subsequent
            request will ensure that a transaction is considered as different.

            A message authentication code ensures the data is authentic and that the intended amount has

            - A key (k) is derived from your licence key
            - A value (v) is produced by concatenating the nonce, amount value and identifier, such as a purchase
              with nonce `0123456789ABCDEF` an amount of £275.95 and an identifier of OD-12345678 would become
              `0123456789ABCDEF27595OD-12345678` and extracting the UTF-8 byte values
            - The result from HMAC_SHA256(k, v) is hex-encoded (upper-case)
            - For instance, a licence key of `LK123456789`, a nonce of `0123456789ABCDEF`, an amount of `27595` and an identifier of `OD-12345678`
             would generate a MAC of `163DBAB194D743866A9BCC7FC9C8A88FCD99C6BBBF08D619291212D1B91EE12E`.

            description: |
              A tag is a label that you can attach to a payment authorisation.
              Tags can help you group transactions together based on certain criteria, like a work job or a ticket number.
              They can also assist in filtering transactions when you're generating reports.

              Limitations:
              There is a maximum limit of 3 tags that can be added to a single transaction. Each tag can be no longer than 20
              characters and alphanumeric with no spaces.

              Example:
              Let's say you're a software company and you have different teams working on various projects. When a team makes
              a purchase or incurs an expense, they can tag the transaction with the project name, the team name, and the
              type of expense.

              - Project Name: Project_X
              - Team Name: Team_A
              - Type of Expense: Hardware

              This way, when you're looking at your financial reports, you can easily filter transactions based on these
              tags to see how much each project or team is spending on different types of expenses.

            The Card Security Code (CSC) (also known as CV2/CVV2) is normally found on the back of the card
            (American Express has it on the front). The value helps to identify possession of the card as it is not
            available within the chip or magnetic swipe.

            When forwarding the CSC, please ensure the value is a string as some values start with 0 and this will be stripped
            out by any integer parsing.

            The CSC number aids fraud prevention in Mail Order and Internet payments.

            Business rules are available on your account to identify whether to accept
            or decline transactions based on mismatched results of the CSC.

            The Payment Card Industry (PCI) requires that at no stage of a transaction should the CSC be stored.

            This applies to all entities handling card data.

            It should also not be used in any hashing process.

            CityPay do not store the value and have no method of retrieving the value once the transaction has been processed.
            For this reason, duplicate checking is unable to determine the CSC in its duplication check algorithm.

            the window, any subsequent transaction will result in a T001 result.

            Values are

             `0` for the default policy (default value if not supplied). Your default values are determined by your account manager on setup of the account.

             `1` for an enforced policy. Transactions that are enforced will be checked for duplication within the duplication window.

             `2` to bypass. Transactions that are bypassed will not be checked for duplication within the duplication window.

            The value should be a valid printable string with ASCII character ranges from 0x32 to 0x127.

            The identifier is recommended to be distinct for each transaction such as a [random unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
            this will aid in ensuring each transaction is identifiable.

            When transactions are processed they are also checked for duplicate requests. Changing the identifier on a subsequent
            request will ensure that a transaction is considered as different.

              A tag is a label that you can attach to a payment authorisation.
              Tags can help you group transactions together based on certain criteria, like a work job or a ticket number.
              They can also assist in filtering transactions when you're generating reports.

              Limitations:
              There is a maximum limit of 3 tags that can be added to a single transaction. Each tag can be no longer than 20
              characters and alphanumeric with no spaces.

              Example:
              Let's say you're a software company and you have different teams working on various projects. When a team makes
              a purchase or incurs an expense, they can tag the transaction with the project name, the team name, and the
              type of expense.

              - Project Name: Project_X
              - Team Name: Team_A
              - Type of Expense: Hardware

              This way, when you're looking at your financial reports, you can easily filter transactions based on these
              tags to see how much each project or team is spending on different types of expenses.

            The value should be a valid printable string with ASCII character ranges from 0x32 to 0x127.

            The identifier is recommended to be distinct for each transaction such as a [random unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
            this will aid in ensuring each transaction is identifiable.

            When transactions are processed they are also checked for duplicate requests. Changing the identifier on a subsequent
            request will ensure that a transaction is considered as different.
