/*
 * CityPay Payment API
 *  This CityPay API is a HTTP RESTful payment API used for direct server to server transactional processing. It provides a number of payment mechanisms including: Internet, MOTO, Continuous Authority transaction processing, 3-D Secure decision handling using RFA Secure, Authorisation, Refunding, Pre-Authorisation, Cancellation/Voids and Completion processing. The API is also capable of tokinsed payments using Card Holder Accounts.  ## Compliance and Security <aside class=\"notice\">   Before we begin a reminder that your application will need to adhere to PCI-DSS standards to operate safely   and to meet requirements set out by Visa and MasterCard and the PCI Security Standards Council including: </aside>  * Data must be collected using TLS version 1.2 using [strong cryptography](#enabled-tls-ciphers). We will not accept calls to our API at   lower grade encryption levels. We regularly scan our TLS endpoints for vulnerabilities and perform TLS assessments   as part of our compliance program. * The application must not store sensitive card holder data (CHD) such as the card security code (CSC) or   primary access number (PAN) * The application must not display the full card number on receipts, it is recommended to mask the PAN   and show the last 4 digits. The API will return this for you for ease of receipt creation * If you are developing a website, you will be required to perform regular scans on the network where you host the   application to meet your compliance obligations * You will be required to be PCI Compliant and the application must adhere to the security standard. Further information   is available from [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) * The API verifies that the request is for a valid account and originates from a trusted source using the remote IP   address. Our application firewalls analyse data that may be an attempt to break a large number of security common   security vulnerabilities.

A card must previously be registered by calling &#x60;/account-register-card&#x60; with the card details  or retrieved using &#x60;/account-retrieve&#x60;  Tokens are generated whenever a previously registered list of cards are retrieved. Each token has, by design a  relatively short time to live of 30 minutes. This is both to safe guard the merchant and card holder from  replay attacks. Tokens are also restricted to your account, preventing malicious actors from stealing details for use elsewhere.    If a token is reused after it has expired it will be rejected and a new token will be required.   Tokenisation can be used for   - repeat authorisations on a previously stored card - easy authorisations just requiring CSC values to be entered - can be used for credential on file style payments - can require full 3-D Secure authentication to retain the liability shift - wallet style usage.
